# WallpaperRetriever
Webscraping subreddits to get wallpaper folders.

## Guide
Requires Client ID and Secret ID from a reddit account, you can generate them [here](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/). ([more in-depth guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-get-client_id-and-client_secret-for-python-reddit-api-registration/))

Specify subreddit, count, minimum width, minimum height, and the name of the folder to save it in. The save folder will be created in your current directory by default (or input a path if you want to get fancy - no guarentees through).
